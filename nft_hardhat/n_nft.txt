🚩🚩🚩 INSTALL PART 🚩🚩🚩
⏩1) 

npm install "hardhat" "ethers" "dotenv"
npm install "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@^2.0.0" "@openzeppelin/contracts"
npm install "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers@^1.0.0" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers@^1.0.0" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan@^3.0.0" "@types/mocha@^9.1.0" "@typechain/ethers-v5@^10.1.0" "@typechain/hardhat@^6.1.2" "chai@^4.2.0" "hardhat-gas-reporter@^1.0.8" "solidity-coverage@^0.7.21" "ts-node@>=8.0.0" "typechain@^8.1.0" "typescript@>=4.5.0"

⏩2) npm init -y
⏩3) npx hardhat



🚩🚩🚩 DOTENV and HARDHAT.CONFIG PART 🚩🚩🚩

⏩4) Make sure you are on Metamask Mumbai testnet (or Goerli testnet, whatever you choose)
and that you have test ether
⏩5) create a .env file at the root of the folder and put inside code below. Be careful about 
template literals and quotes.
PRIVATE_KEY="....mymetamask account private key......"
PROVIDER_URL=`...the https endpoint from alchemy.....`


⏩6) Get the private key of your metamask account and paste it above.
⏩7) Then go to Alchemy website, create a profile, go to Dashboard, click on "create application",
then choose "Matic" and then "Mumbai". Then click to "create"
Then click on "keys" and copy your "https" enpoint and paste it above.

⏩8) Add ".env" to your .gitignore file

⏩9) Go to hardhat.config.js and put inside:

require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.1",
  networks: {
    matic: {
      url: process.env.PROVIDER_URL,
      accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    }
  }
};


If you choose "Goerli" testnet, change "matic" above to "goerli"

⏩10) Make sure you contract and hardhat.config file have the same compiler version.


🚩🚩🚩 PINATA PART 🚩🚩🚩


⏩11) Upload your jpeg image photo to pinata or ipfs desktop.
The image must be JPEG or otherwise you will not see it on nft test marketplaces such as "opensea testnets"

⏩12) Copy the CID put it as below to your browser to see if your file is uploaded. Of course the CID below, should be replaced

by your CID.

PINATA VERSION:
https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZTjyffeWkFGnMnaC9kC9RBQ63GR2nxwfenQx6hhUoPwN

IPFS DESKTOP VERSION:
ipfs://QmZTjyffeWkFGnMnaC9kC9RBQ63GR2nxwfenQx6hhUoPwN

⏩13) Copy the url link above
⏩14) Create json file at the root of your folder such as "metadata_nft1.json" and 
put inside this code (paste the link of step 3 as below):
description, image and name are the most important parts.

{
    "image": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmfCTKMJ9HL3sUiLdPVzRC6wQcycr7QK8ammqSPJsXPsNq",
    "description": "a nice flower again",
    "name": "flower again"
}

For IPFS Desktop version, just replace above image line with below. The rest is the same:
	"image": "ipfs://QmTDqYFfYpGNgQJoFPzUEEYcX6Hxc27JT4yiyJtbZB5Ceq",

⏩15) Then upload your json file to pinata account or to your IPFS Desktop. And copy the CID number and paste as below to the 
browser to see if it works:
PINATE:
https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdyUjhHKBx4zsxkDcVweuagkgRiyJN2qManRxJnwQZVT6
IPFS:
ipfs://QmZde57UC4D6V5asJxsvsyYa8wkoX45oQei6Q3xNLxEgiy



⏩16) You'll need json file link later when you mint your nft. This will be tokenUri

🚩🚩🚩  HARDHAT PART 🚩🚩🚩

⏩17) Create your contract: Nusaybin.sol and paste inside:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.1;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
contract Goat is ERC721, ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIdCounter;
    constructor() ERC721("Goat NFT", "GOAT") {}
    function safeMint(address to, string memory uri) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current();
        _tokenIdCounter.increment();
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);
    }
    // The following functions are overrides required by Solidity.
    function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage) {
        super._burn(tokenId);
    }
    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public
        view
        override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage)
        returns (string memory)
    {
        return super.tokenURI(tokenId);
    }
}

⏩18) Make sure compiler versions are the same across ".sol" and "hardhat.config.js" files
⏩19) Then configure deploy.js
async function main() {
  const Goat = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Goat");
  const goat = await Goat.deploy();
  await goat.deployed();
  console.log("Goat Contract is deployed to:", goat.address);
}

⏩20) npx hardhat compile

⏩21) npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network matic

⏩22) copy contract address inside .env file:
CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "...contract address......"


⏩23) 

⏩24) npx hardhat compile

⏩25) npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network matic

⏩26) Copy the contract addrflatten > flattened.sol

This will create a single contract file at the root of your folder. We need this single contract file
because for verification we need to upload all our code at once to polygon.etherscan.

Then open flattened.sol on code editor, and delete all "SPDX-..." lines because there are more many of these lines
and it causes error. Delete all of them and type only one at the top of flattened.sol:
//SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL3.0

⏩30) Then copy all flattened.sol and go to polygon.etherscan, 
choose single file, then "gpl v3" and then click to "continue"

Then paste inside the box and click on "verify".

⏩31) once your contract is verified, it will create an interface for you interact with your contract.

Go to "safeMint" function, paste your metamask account in address area
Then paste json file link in tokenUri area
and click to "write"

This will promt metamask and it will ask you to sign the transaction. Once you sign, it will take some time and your
metamask account will have the NFT token.

⏩32) To check it, go to to "https://testnets.opensea.io/"
Make sure you are on your metamask account dashboard. 
There you should see your nft image.

⏩33) You can also check nft on your metamask.
Go to metamask, click on "import tokens"
Then paste contract address.
Then wait 2 seconds for the name to appear.
Then enter "0" inside decimal place and click to "import".
You should see your NFT token.
